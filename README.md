# nrf51822_ws
Workspace for nrf51822 build

Remark:  When the files have been uploaded, the following warining was rised: The file will have its original line endings in your working directory. warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF ! (details cna be found here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5834014/lf-will-be-replaced-by-crlf-in-git-what-is-that-and-is-it-important).
Therefore if downloaded on a windows machine, it will work ok, but on linux system it may not.


Later edit: zip archives have been added where the CRLF.LF change has not been performed.
